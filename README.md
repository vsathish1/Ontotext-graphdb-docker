# GraphDB + Python 3 + Java 8 + Maven 3.5


## You need to get your own free download version for docker to build successfully
- Default Docker build-arg is set to use 10.0.2 version. You can change that in "docker.env" file.
```
GRAPHDB_VERSION=10.0.2
```
- You can go to Ontotext web site to register to download the free version, **graphdb-free-10.0.2-dist.zip**, and place in this directory as shown below.
- Then, you can use (build.sh: optional to build your own locally) run scripts to start using.
- NOTE: used existing docker repo "openkbs"
